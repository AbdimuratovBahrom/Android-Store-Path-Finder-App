StorePathFinderApp - Android Studio project (skeleton)
=====================================

What this provides:
- A small Android project that opens your site inside a fullscreen WebView.
- SplashActivity shows a splash screen for 3 seconds, then starts MainActivity.
- No address bar â€” the WebView is full screen.
- Internet permission added.

How to use:
1. Download and unzip this archive.
2. Open the folder in Android Studio.
3. Let Gradle sync. If plugin versions prompt updates, follow Android Studio recommendations.
4. Replace the placeholder app icon (res/mipmap) and splash logo (activity_splash.xml ImageView src).
5. Build -> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) -> Build APK(s).

Note:
- The project uses minimal files so Android Studio may ask to upgrade Gradle plugin or Kotlin plugin.
- If you want, send the app icon and I will place it into the project.
